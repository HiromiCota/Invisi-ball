v0.06 (Hiromi)
Emitter is even better! Ties into the ball's velocity, so that it shuts off 
 when it goes too slowly and throws more sparks when it's moving swiftly
Collisions with blocks and the floor create collision events that get processed

v0.05 (Hiromi)
Emitter works as intended now.
Ball now invisible. Move the ball to get a basic idea of where you are.
Grey block pre-fab added. 

v0.04 (Hiromi)
Ball can now roll.
Level expanded greatly.
Added particle system to ball.
Bug: Emitter stops when ball stops, but doesn't restart.

v0.03 (Hiromi)
Buttons now lock other buttons 
i.e. First button down fires; ties go to [in order] mouse, red, green, and blue.
(Yellow never wins ties.)
Buttons respond to keyboard, mouse, and gamepad input.
Buttons *probably* respond to touch input, but that's not been tested.

v0.02 (Hiromi)
Full suite of buttons added. 
Block groups added.
Buttons still don't lock out other buttons yet.
Bug: Blocks currently trap the ball if you're not fast. Will fix next iteration.

v0.01 (Hiromi)
Button scripting now works individually. Buttons do not yet lock out other buttons.

v0.01b (Brandon)
Upgraded Unity to 2017.3.0p3 and other good stuff

v0.01a (Hiromi)
Created level geometry and prototype UI.
(Also, a button script that doesn't work.)
